# Intermittent AsyncStorage Error in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug involving inconsistent errors when using AsyncStorage in a React Native application.  The app sporadically crashes with a `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.getItem')` error.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the intermittent failure to retrieve data from AsyncStorage. The error suggests that AsyncStorage is not properly initialized or accessible at the time the `getItem` method is called.  This behavior is inconsistent and challenging to reproduce reliably.

## Solution

The provided solution introduces improved error handling and ensures AsyncStorage is ready before attempting to access it.
